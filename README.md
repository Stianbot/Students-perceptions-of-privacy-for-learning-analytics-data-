The explainations of what the numbers represents are available in [labels.csv](https://github.com/Stianbot/Students-perceptions-of-privacy-for-learning-analytics-data-/blob/main/labels.csv) and [variables.csv](https://github.com/Stianbot/Students-perceptions-of-privacy-for-learning-analytics-data-/blob/main/variables.csv).
